<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Onur Ãœnal. I graduated from Hacettepe University in 2021. My major was in Math and I met with programming thanks to classes I take in university. Started with Python language. Before I graduate, I also tried to learn front-end web development and managed to learn a few things about html and css but I had to take a break because of my difficult lessons in the math department.</p>

<p>After my graduation, I met with android development and learned kotlin. With kotlin I also managed to learn the basics of java. Every time I learned a new thing, my hunger for more knowledge grow. Searching for answers in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> or improving my skills in sites like <a href="https://academy.patika.dev/">patika</a> or <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">udemy</a> is my day to day job. I love programming!</p>

<p>Right now I'm learning front-end web development and achieving my dreams from college.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking a time learn a few things about me. Have a great day!</p>
